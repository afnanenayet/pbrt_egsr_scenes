# PBRT EGSR Scenes

This repo contains some of the scenes that we either experimented with or used
in the paper that was submitted to EGSR ("Orthogonal Array Sampling for Monte
Carlo Rendering").

These are standard PBRT scene files that were taken from Benedikt Bitterli's
[website](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/resources/), which contains an
excellent set of free resources for anyone that needs a scene to render. We
have made some slight modifications to these scenes to make them more suitable
for our paper.
